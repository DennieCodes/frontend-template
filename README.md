# Senior Living Services

## Problem Statement

In the United States, millions of individuals and families face confusion, stress, and lack of information when navigating the complex landscape of services available to seniors. Whether it's finding appropriate in-home care, understanding Medicare/Medicaid, locating nearby senior centers, or accessing legal and financial support, many people discover—often during a crisis—that they are under-informed and ill-prepared. Despite the existence of many services, the information is fragmented, outdated, or hard to find.

## Target Audience

- Adult children of aging parents seeking support
- Seniors looking for trusted resources and services
- Social workers, case managers, and healthcare professionals
- Community organizations that support the elderly
